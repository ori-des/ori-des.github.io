Another challenge my teacher put my way was to generate a file called 'latest.html' in which I displayed the newest entries in my blog.<br>
Having built my generator in python, my first idea was to add the logic for this in the same file so I could generate all in one go.<br>
But there was a big problem, how could I use python to write in the middle of a PHP file so that the html would be generated around it?
That seemed like too complicated of a feat.<br> 
Another problem I was encountering was, how do I get the latest file?
My first approach was to compare the two directories I'm using to generate my files, and always append the newest file of the input folder to the top of my list.<br>
This is how far I got with python:
<pre>
<code>
	import os

	input_dir = "root"
	output_dir = "blog"
	fname = []
	latest = open("blog/latest.html", "a")

	input_files = os.listdir(input_dir)
	output_files = os.listdir(output_dir)

	for file in input_files:
    		fname.append(f"{os.path.basename(file).split(".")[0]}.html")

	non_common_files = sorted(list(set(fname) ^ set(output_files)))

	for file in non_common_files:
    		print(file)


	print(input_files)
	print(output_files)
	print(non_common_files)
</code>
</pre>

But once I realized that the first problem was too big of an obstacle, I scrapped everything and decided to work directly in my latest.php file, so that when I call my python generator program, the PHP script will run and generate the info I need in the middle of my two "include()" functions.<br>
<br>
<div class="mini-title">Using PHP</div>
<br>
After taking care of the top and bottom include() functions and the misc. pieces of html I needed to make the formatting work, I started building the script-in-the-middle.<br>
I decided to scrap the two folder comparison method to get the latest addition and just sort the files by last modified date.<br>
After some googling to figure out how to list the files in a directory in PHP and its oddities of having to filter from the two dots variables you get, this is what I wrote down: <br>
<br>
<pre>
<code>
	$dir = "root";
    	$files = scandir($dir);
    	$files = array_diff($files, array(".", ".."));
</code>
</pre>
<br>
I then wrote a loop to go through the files and get their last modified date with the filemtime() function, echoing it on my file so I could see the output:<br>
<br>
<pre>
<code>
	foreach($files as $file){
        	$mod_date = filemtime("$dir/$file");
		echo $file . " " . date("d/m/Y h:i:s", $mod_date) . "< br>";
	}
</code>
</pre>
<br>
The filemtime() function doesn't directly give you the date but a number that, and I'm guessing here, gets translated into a readable date for the user with the date() function.<br>
After a bit of struggling with the sorting, first trying to use just an array but then opting for an associative array, I took advantage of the filemtime() peculiarity.<br>
I created the associative array in the first loop, then I used the arsort() function to sort it by value.<br>
I started another foreach loop in which I included a counter so that only the first five files would be printed, and then echoed the html needed to create a link and the filename together to print a working list of links.<br>
<br>
This was the final script:<br>
<br>
<pre>
<code>
    $dir = "root";
    $files = scandir($dir);
    $files = array_diff($files, array(".", ".."));
    $file_mod_dates = array();

    foreach($files as $file){
        $mod_date = filemtime("$dir/$file");
        $file_mod_dates[$file] = $mod_date;
    }

    arsort($file_mod_dates);

    $i = 0;
    foreach($file_mod_dates as $file => $date){
        $file = explode(".", $file)[0];
        if($i == 5){
            break;
        }
        echo date("d/m/Y h:i:s", $date) . " < a href=\" linkurlhere $file.html\">entry $file.</ a> < br>";
        $i++;
    }  
</code>
</pre>
