        My software development journey started less than a year ago. I wanted to learn a skill that's useful in the job market, but that could also help me in my creative endeavors.<br>
        This wasn't my first encounter ever with code, I was a tumblr kid and I managed to learn as a teen how to change the html of the templates to make it more my own (I never learned how to write it from scratch, but I knew where to look to find what I needed), and I had already followed a YouTube C# tutorial where I was given a basic introduction to arrays and loops (I wanted to use unity).<br>
        But I wouldn't really count that as the start of my journey, since it was barely any learning at all.<br> 
        I wanted to take it more seriously this time and learn how to CODE, not just how to barely use Unity. So I started watching coding influencers on YouTube to see what kind of advice they would give on how to start.<br> 
        The most popular options were FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project.
        At first I went with FreeCodeCamp, followed their html, css and javascript course. I was excited to start learning javascript so I kinda rushed the html and css, but I managed to at least get familiar with those.<br> 
        The javascript part was decently challenging, but I was frustrated that 
        there wasn't any 'real life' use of the language (didn't build any website with it. I should add that I followed what is now their 'legacy curriculum'). I had a lot of fun (and hardship) solving their algorithm challenges though.<br>
        After that I decided to take a step back and start Odin project from the beginning, and I think that my html and css learning from that was more successful. It could be that now I was focusing on more advanced stuff, meanwhile when I started of FreeCodeCamp I was getting familiar with everything. I also like that they taught me how to use git and how to write code on a text editor and browser instead of using codepen.<br>
        I managed to work on some projects that were challenging and rewarding, both in their appearance and in their functions. I'm especially proud of my calculator.<br>
        After their foundations course I was advised by a software engineer friend of mine to go through the book "Learn Python the Hard Way" by Zed Shaw. It was definitely a different learning style. For a big chunk of the book I had to copy the code he wrote. During most of it I felt like I was going through the concepts I learned about during my javascript course but using a different syntax.<br> 
        What changed was that I now was interacting with files on my computer (I dabbled a bit in node.js to work on a challenge from a coding advent calendar and I noticed how easier and less painful the process with python is compared to node).<br>
        Another difference between the two languages are OBJECTS. In javascript they are basically a special kind of array, in Python they are a special kind of function (or at least that's my understanding of it right now).<br>
        I'm still confused about Python objects and I don't like object oriented programming at all.<br>
        In the end I didn't really finish the book and I spent my time coding a little text adventure game about my special interest (Jesus mythicism).<br>
        For a few months life called and I worked a terrible retail job that didn't leave me any time to learn programming. Now that I quit that I'm back at it but what's next?<br>
        I want to learn as much as possible, I'm especially curious to learn how does it all work together, how does the back-end intertwine with the front-end? I want to learn how to build something from beginning to end product!<br>
        Thank you for your time bye have a nice day!
